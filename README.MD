# Overview

This program shows how SQLite, python, GitHub, and VS Studio can all be used together to run a serverless Database. 

[Software Demo Video](http://youtube.link.goes.here)

# Relational Database

I am using the SQLite module from the python library.


Table Structure:
* children
where:
		-child_id: Sequential number of entries.
		child_name: Name of Child.
		c_Birth_date: Birth date of Child.
        c_Age: Age of Child

* Animals
where:
		animal_id: Sequential number of entries.
		animal_name: Name of Animal
		a_Birth_date: Birth date of Animal
        a_Age: Age of Animal

# Development Environment

Python, VS Code, and the SQL module are all used here.
